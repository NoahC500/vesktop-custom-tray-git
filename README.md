# Vesktop PKGBUILD with system Electron & custom tray icon
This repo contains a PKGBUILD and associated files for [Vesktop](https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop/).

It patches in the custom tray icon settings from PolisanTheEasyNick's [PR #517](https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop/pull/517) on the Vesktop repo.

The PKGBUILD is based, in part, on the [vesktop_electron](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vesktop_electron) AUR package's PKGBUILD.

The .sh and .Desktop files are also taken from the AUR package, but modified in accordance with the PKGBUILD.

Any issues, let me know, hopefully this helps someone :)
