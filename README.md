# Vesktop PKGBUILD with system Electron & custom tray icon
This repo holds a PKGBUILD which incorporates [MrGarlic1's](https://github.com/MrGarlic1/Vesktop) repo as it includes a patch to allow customisation of the system tray icon. ([PR #576](https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop/pull/576))

The PKGBUILD is based, in part, on the [vesktop_electron](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vesktop_electron) AUR package's PKGBUILD

The .sh and .Desktop files are also taken from the AUR package, but modified in accordance with the PKGBUILD

Any issues, let me know, hopefully this helps someone :)
